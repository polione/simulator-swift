abstract = {Apache Hadoop is an important framework for fault-tolerant and distributed storage and processing of Big Data. Hadoop core platform along with other open-source tools such as Apache Hive, Storm, HBase offer an ecosystem to enable users to fully harness Big Data potential. Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry provide access control capabilities to several ecosystem components by offering centralized policy administration and enforcement through plugins. In this work we discuss the access control model for Hadoop ecosystem (referred as HeAC) used by Apache Ranger (release 0.6) and Sentry (release 1.7.0) along with Hadoop 2.x native authorization capabilities. This multi-layer model provides several access enforcement points to restrict unauthorized users to cluster resources. We further outline some preliminary approaches to extend the HeAC model consistent with widely accepted access control models.},

In this paper, we focus on one of the key data security services, that is, access control, by highlighting the differences with traditional data management systems and describing a set of requirements that any access control solution for Big Data platforms may fulfill. We then describe the state of the art and discuss open research issues.},

abstract="Hadoop ecosystem provides a highly scalable, fault-tolerant and cost-effective platform for storing and analyzing variety of data formats. Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry are two predominant frameworks used to provide authorization capabilities in Hadoop ecosystem. In this paper we present a formal multi-layer access control model (called {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}HeAC{\}}{\$}{\$}) for Hadoop ecosystem, as an academic-style abstraction of Ranger, Sentry and native Apache Hadoop access-control capabilities. We further extend {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}HeAC{\}}{\$}{\$}base model to provide a cohesive object-tagged role-based access control (OT-RBAC) model, consistent with generally accepted academic concepts of RBAC. Besides inheriting advantages of RBAC, OT-RBAC offers a novel method for combining RBAC with attributes (beyond NIST proposed strategies). Additionally, a proposed implementation approach for OT-RBAC in Apache Ranger, is presented. We further outline attribute-based extensions to OT-RBAC.",

abstract = {Data security and privacy issues are magnified by the volume, the variety, and the velocity of Big Data and by the lack, up to now, of a reference data model and related data manipulation languages. In this paper, we focus on one of the key data security services, that is, access control, by highlighting the differences with traditional data management systems and describing a set of requirements that any access control solution for Big Data platforms may fulfill. We then describe the state of the art and discuss open research issues.},
